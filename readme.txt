Virtual Tissue Simulator (VTS) Project
Copyright (c) 2009 - 2017 Laser Microbeam and Medical Program

This cross-platform GUI is an Angular 2 application that uses the Vts library in NuGet.

To add the Angular 2 libraries, install the npm package manager:
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node.

There is a file in the Folder Vts.Gui.Angular called package.json which defines which packages to install. 
Open a teminal window (command window in Windows) here and run the following command:
> npm install

In Visual Studio 2010, 2013 or 2015, open the file <Vts.Gui dir>/src/Vts.Gui.sln

Rebuild the application to bring in the nuget packages, select Default.aspx and "Set As Start Page", run the application.
